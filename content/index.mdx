# Introduction
Hey there! Welcome to NimeraCP - it's a slick web control panel we built to make running L2jAcis servers a breeze.

## What is NimeraCP?

Think of NimeraCP as your server's command center. We created it to take the headache out of managing L2jAcis servers. You get a clean, easy-to-use interface where you can control everything about your Lineage 2 server. Want to run mini-games or set up an item shop? No problem. If you're running a server and want something that just works, this is for you.

## Cool Stuff You Can Do

- **Server Dashboard**: See how your server's doing at a glance - no digging through database needed
- **Buy & Sell**: Let players trade items through the auction house and shop
- **Track Progress**: Keep tabs on who's winning, boss statusses, Olympiad rankings, PvP scores and more
- **Mini-games**: Give players some fun side activities with rewards up for grabs
- **Refer Friends**: Set up bonuses for players who bring their friends to your server
- **Clan Management**: Players can handle their clan stuff right from the Launchpad
