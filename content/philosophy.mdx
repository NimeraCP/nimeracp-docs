## Why Another Control Panel?

Look, we know there are other control panels out there - WizardCP, AtualStudio, MMOWeb, to name a few. But let's be real: they're either crazy expensive, stuck in 2010, or... well, let's just say they won't win any design awards.

## Our Take

We wanted something different. Something that wouldn't make you choose between your server budget and a decent control panel. Something built with modern tech that actually looks good and works well.

## Built for Everyone

So we rolled up our sleeves and created NimeraCP. We used modern frameworks and best practices, but kept it simple and accessible. No crazy pricing, no outdated tech, just a solid control panel that:

- Won't break the bank
- Looks clean and modern
- Actually works the way you'd expect
- Keeps up with current web standards
- Is open and community-driven

## The Bottom Line

We believe running a Lineage 2 server shouldn't require a degree in computer science or a fat wallet. NimeraCP is our way of giving back to the L2 community - a modern, affordable solution that just makes sense.
